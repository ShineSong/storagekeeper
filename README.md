Default search distance is 10 ( about 3/4 screen width in center ).

## How does it work?
Chaos boxes is big problem when play DST with friend ,especially when you have 4 or more friends shared one camp.Players hard work to collect things will make the storage too mess to find what you want.And the diffusion will waste slots of storage.So I dev this mod to free me from boring frequent arrangement work.

When you sort your chest or icebox, the mod search for the nearby chest and icebox within distance(default 10).Then classify stuffs by categories,e.g. resources,tools,weapons.Next merge the stackable items which can be.Finally push all of them into storage,current opened chest have highest priority so the current container will be filled first.
